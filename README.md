# it-logger
React App to log IT issues using Redux and Materialize CSS.

Following a code-a-long with a Brad Traversy Udemy course.

This is my first venture into the world of Redux, if anyone has any comments on how to make my code cleaner or better in any way don't hesitate to point it out.

If anyone makes it this far thank you for your time!
